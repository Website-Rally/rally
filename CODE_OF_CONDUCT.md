# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive or inflammatory
- If you encounter an issue, please email <od@stephan.co.uk>

## Where does the CoC apply?

On our GitHub, in all Hack Club Slack channels (Hack Club CoC also applies there) and calls.

## Hacker Values

These are the values to which people in the Rally community should aspire.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
    - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
- Be thoughtful
    - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
    - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
    - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
    - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
    - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
    - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
    - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

## Unwelcome behavior

These actions are explicitly forbidden in Hack Club spaces:

- Expressing or provoking:
    - insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
    - discrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;
    - bullying or systematic harassment;
    - unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
- Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.

## Moderation and Enforcement

If you act in a such a way that doesn't align with the Hacker Values or conduct yourself in such a way that is forbidden above, you will be warned and asked to stop.
Repeated offences may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

- On your first offense, you will receive a written warning, and may be asked to apologise publicly or privately to the part you have offended.
- On a second offense, you will be temporarily removed from the community, the length of the ban will depend on the severity of the situation. **This ban does not indicate that you are no longer welcomed in the community** - it represents an official warning for your behaviour.
- On a third offense, you may be asked to leave the community.
